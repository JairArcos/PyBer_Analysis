# PyBer_Analysis
Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy to perform summary statistics.

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of Pyber_Analysis is to built an exploratory analysis of the ride-sharing data by city type,summarizing the difference between city types about riders, driver and fares; based on descriptic statistics to do decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

Analyzing summary dataframe we can observed some key facts:
- Rural city type has lower rides and drivers than in suburban or urban city type. 
- Fare per ride or driver is lower in Urban city type. 
- Urban city type has a 1.60 ratio between riders/drivers, an estimation of 1.60 rides per driver, in comparisson with Urban city type, ratio is 0.67, maybe we need to do more analysis to understand better, nonetheless it is being showed there is an opportunity where some drivers could have 0 rides. 
- Urban drivers are getting lower fare average in less rides , when in rural city drivers have more rides with higher fares.

## Summary:

- Review and implement a KPI about rides per driver on detail to identify 0 rides opportunities, or even, take a look on drivers with higher rides and try to identify patterns about why some drivers are getting 0 rides and some drivers more than 1 (in case it is applicable)
- It would be great to include on this analysis, rides cancelled, to see if Urban city type is getting higher cancelation due to its less quatity of drivers, and vice versa with Rural city type. 
- At the end of Feb 2019 it is observed high total fare by city type in all cities, take a look on what could be different in that time, was it due to a holliday? due to an event that affect those three city type?.. etc.
